This template uses \href{https://da.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_natbib}{natbib} to handle the bibliography. This requires a bibliography file (zotero can autogenerate these) placed in the main folder of your project. In this demo it is called \texttt{references.bib}. If you wish to change this name, adjust the line linking to this file at the bottom of \texttt{main.tex}. 

By default references look like this: \cite{mullainathan_machine_2017}. If you have more than two citations at a single place they are autocollapsed: \cite{shalit_estimating_2016,brunicardi_overview_2011,ginsburg_precision_2018}
 To change this adjust the options passed to natbib at the top of \texttt{main.tex}.
