The theme keeps most of the writing in separate files in the \texttt{02\_chapters} folder. I suggest that whenever you want to create a new section, you create a new \texttt{.tex} file here, and insert the section in \texttt{main.tex} with the \texttt{input} command. Look at the source for this demo to understand exactly how. 

The folder \texttt{01\_preamble} contains various code that determines the look of the document. Unless you want to make changes to the layout this folder shouldn't be changed. If you need additional packages you can add them in \texttt{01\_preamble/packages.tex}.
