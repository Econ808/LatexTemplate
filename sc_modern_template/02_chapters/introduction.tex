\dropcap{W}elcome to my modern-style latex template and thank you for using it. I hope you like it. The template should behave very much like all other \LaTeX documents. Below you will find some notes on how to use the template. The template itself is a mix of \href{https://github.com/cmichi/latex-template-collection}{this} template by \href{https://github.com/cmichi}{cmichi} and various stuff from the submission templates for Science and PNAS, which are both available on Overleaf.
